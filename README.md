# Voice-Sample-Filtering-Selection

## Details about the Project
This project aims to create a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack website that allows users to filter and select voice samples. The website will feature a sidebar filled with various filters, such as gender, language, age, and a reset button to clear the filters. By applying these filters, users can narrow down their search for specific voice samples.

## Features
- Sidebar Filters: The website will have a sidebar containing filters like gender, language, and age. Users can select one or multiple filters to refine their search for voice samples. The sidebar will also have a reset button to clear all applied filters.
- Voice Sample List: A list of voice samples will be displayed on the main content area based on the applied filters. Each voice sample will be represented by a component containing relevant information such as the speaker's name, tags, and a play button.
- Audio Playback: When a user clicks the play button for a particular voice sample, the corresponding audio will start playing. This feature allows users to preview the voice samples before selecting them.
- Hover and Select Button: When a user hovers over a voice sample component, a select button will appear. By clicking on this button, the user can select the audio and receive a notification displaying the selected audio name. This interaction provides a convenient way for users to choose their desired voice sample.
